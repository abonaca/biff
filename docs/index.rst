Biff (``biff``)
***************

Biff is a Python package for evaluating basis function expansions of mass
densities and gravitational potentials. Currently, the only implemented
expansion is the Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method of Hernquist & Ostriker
(1992; [HO92]_) using Hernquist radial functions and spherical harmonics for
angular functions. This implementation is based on the formalism described in
the original paper but using the notation of Lowing et al. (2011; [L11]_).

TODO: note difference in coefficients from HO92 - use Lowing form
